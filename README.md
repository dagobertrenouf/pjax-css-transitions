pjax-css-transitions
====================

Experimenting with page transitions using pjax and css3 transitions.

# Goals

## Feeling of immediacy
- Have page turn animation launch on click, let content appear on it as it loads
- Let loaded element appear with a fade + movement of arrival on the page when they're loaded (do it separately on each (image, text) depending on individual loading completion)
- Add fastclick js for better reactivity testing on mobile

## Book feeling
- Make it feel like a book that turn pages left and right depending on number chosen relative to current
- Add next / prev arrows

## Add images
- Add images to be able to test experience better

## "All pages" screen
- Add view with all pages browsable, on which you can zoom in to access the page you want and access the "book" experience
